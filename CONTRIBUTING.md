Conflogt is an open source project and we love to receive contributions from our community â€” you! There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code which can be incorporated into conflogt itself.

## How to?
We use GitHub to track issues, bugs and feature requests. Please feel free to [open an issue](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/creating-an-issue).

We also use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), so all code changes happen through Pull Requests. Working on your first Pull Request? You can learn how from this free series, [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/courses/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).
